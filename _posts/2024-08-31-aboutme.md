Are our lives written done before we were born? If yes, does it also consider our personalities? Our willpower will make decisions throughout our lives, and each of them is like choosing a direction in a complex road crossing. A sequence of decisions will also take us to different places, with different scenery along the journey.

Is luck important? I would definitely say ‘yes’. But is it also written in our lives? Even if yes, life is still mysterious and exciting, just like a great movie whose plots are clear to the producer, but totally new to the audiences. It would be more exciting if the movie is interactive, and each decision can lead to different destinations.

We are born to experience the rich and colorful of this world. If we only seek guaranteed success, would our lives be way too boring? Amid countless possibilities, we should find the path to hope and make decisions with our own willpower (Kakegurui – Compulsive Gambler). No matter whether it is happiness, sadness, euphoria, depression, they are necessary components of our lives and they help us to achieve the fullness of life. This is beautifully expressed in the Zen saying, “The snow falls, each flake in its appropriate place” (Eckhart Tolle).

**“People, who can’t throw something important away, can never hope to change anything.” – *Attack on Titan***
