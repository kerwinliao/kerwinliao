Many people live in unconsciousness throughout their whole lives. Though the proverb says that “ignorance is bliss”, I am more interested in who I am, why I am thinking or acting in this way, but not that way. When myself becomes a study object of me, everything becomes interesting.

MBTI test tells me that I am an ISTJ/INFJ person. While I totally agree with **I** and **J**, the other two dimensions are quite balanced in the final scores. Recalling the past years of my life, I find myself a weird paradox in many aspects, if not all. I do appreciate those who did not speak “weirdo” in front of me to avoid hurting my dignity…

- a risk-averse person who enjoys taking risks
- an obtuse but bright person
	- My way of thinking is more aligned with "sensing", which means that I need to spend quite a lot of time to **sense** the environment to have a broad picture. This process is long and makes me look obtuse...
	- When everything becomes familiar, then I will be the **King** of this environment.
- deliberate in counsel, prompt in action
	- Look like stuck on the road sometimes, but I would interpret that situation as the moment when cougars are looking for targets and waiting for the best time to take action
	- When the opportunity comes, act promptly without letting the target go.
- conservative and iconoclast 
- serious and facetious (you can tell this from my website :) )
- a loner who enjoy talking to strangers

One of my advisors commented: "This is so atypical, even a bit weird. Why do you decide to do it this way?"

Well, the answer is that I am unique, even weird in many aspects, and if I am following others' steps, how can I break the mold and differentiate from other people?
