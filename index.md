### My Idol

Philip A. Khun: _Soulstealer_

He finished this book in 14 years, during which many skepticism arose. However, his perseverance and down-to-earth spirit were not affected at all but his publication of this book substantiated his unique academic excellence in Chinese History and Politics.
